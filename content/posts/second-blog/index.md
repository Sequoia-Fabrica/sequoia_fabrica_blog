    in Just-
    spring when the world is mud-
    luscious the little
    lame balloonman
    whistles far and wee
    and eddieandbill come
    running from marbles and
    piracies and it's
    spring
    when the world is puddle-wonderful
    the queer
    old balloonman whistles
    far and wee
    and bettyandisbel come dancing
    from hop-scotch and jump-rope and
    it's
    spring
    and
    the
    goat-footed
    balloonMan whistles
    far
    and
    wee
